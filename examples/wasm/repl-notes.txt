Need to re-write REPL or create a new example that periodically calls into JS to see if a command is ready.

TODO: create an example to retrieve string from JS:
https://emscripten.org/docs/api_reference/emscripten.h.html
See EM_ASM_INT

Once that works, can start building out the bigger JS example.

Eventually need to clean everything up so we can build from master, but that is a larger project
